      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",

      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "So the easiest way to do this is kind of go from left to right."

      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "And then as far as the folders, Linda did a great job of organizing all their folders, so it shouldn't be too difficult to get it all in, which is exciting."

      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "We were under the assumption that it was, you know, half a million dollars a year, so we were considering replacing it."
    },

      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "But now we're just going to be bolstering it with a connection to Vantage Points to feed the line items that pull project information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "So that can be automatic a analysis of the line items that will pull incremental data from Vantage point on a weekly or bi weekly basis to approve line items and then a process of exporting the data so that Jeffrey doesn't have to do what he normally does, which is, you know, about 30 minutes to an hour of reshaping the data for each of the builders, which again is pieces from Vantage Point and then pieces from Systemo coming together in an Excel reshaping process."

      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "I don't want to say it's the last ERP system that we're looking in, but before we start putting a lot of time into Vantage Point, we do want to make sure we have this workday demo, which is scheduled for Thursday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "So we will have that on Thursday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "And again, if it's amazing, then we have to obviously, you know, rethink what our move is for working on the ERP and making that better for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "But if it's not anything, if it's anything short of amazing, we're going to put all that effort into Vantage Point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "Had a lot of conversations with Temple, Mike Foulke as well, just about making sure that we have all those dashboards, dash parts, things like that."

      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "But the workday is on Thursday."

      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "So we've had all of the small group discussions with Vantage Points."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "We have the larger coming together tomorrow."
    },

      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "Kind of gather all the feedback that we receive in the small groups, discuss it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "We also have the meeting with Graham, the Deltec rep tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "So that's a short."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "He scheduled for 30 minutes initial scoping discussion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "So both of those tomorrow ahead of the workday on Thursday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "And let's see what else we got here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Mark, while you're looking at notes really."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Quickly, I just want to tell you about the guy, Graham."
    },

      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Because I've already met with him before when it was just me and Mark Friendly on the call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "He definitely wants to save ISIS business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "And so, I mean, obviously that's like a decent account for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So what I would do is while you're on that call, also, is there."

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So just as a reminder to like, ask like about what other consultants, consulting agencies that they use and how we."

      "text": "So."

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
