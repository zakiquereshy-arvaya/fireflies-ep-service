      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So I need to, like, a refresher on that, because you shared it with me for a little bit last week, but quite honestly, I kind of forgot, so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "So I built a project management tool for us, and it still needs a couple of tweaks for us, but you were saying we can repurpose that for ice."

      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "As far as what Kyle built, that would."

      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "Like, a knowledge base that's just articles of information."

      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "Not just."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "But that's articles of information in an organized fashion for them to see the mirrors and the limb videos."

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Gotcha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "And yours is more of, like, power, like, almost like dashboards and stuff."

      "speaker": "Mark Lohr",
      "text": "Yep."
    },

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Got it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "But it's more of, like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "It's project financials."

    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So it's not Project like ops, like the tasks."

      "speaker": "David Hogg",
      "text": "It can be, it can be either."
    },

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Because I know that one of the things that Mitchell discussed was he wanted more of like a streamlined product task."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So like if you get, if you win this contract, right, so you win this bridge contract or whatever, like the product task assignment which all are going to go talk to, will also feed into like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Okay, now what is like all those tasks under each person, what do they need to do for that project?"

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So it's like built out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So we need to kind of figure out how we could streamline that or set it up where they can easily import those tasks in themselves and then they're able to like track the actual project rather than just the contract to win."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So we have the contract to win and then once you win the contract, we need those tasks as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "So that's like all I think should be in Monday and then Monday will be one project management like system."
    },

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Does that make sense?"

      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
      "text": "And then so erp, I think like, as far as like, I know that Ryan, you said David, but do you want to like throw David Anzac you on the erp because there's a lot of like overlays on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think the good thing is, is they work so closely together anyway so that when Zach is needed, he'll just plug him in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "I think that as far as like having a project champion for, you know, our client to know who to speak to, we got to have a point person and I think that should be David, especially with his experience and in the financial space."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "So I think he's the pride and champion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "As needed, he'll pull in Zaki and then as far as Zacky, that's going to switch over to the open asset especially because what we're doing is a lot similar, very similar to the rag model that he's built."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ryan Botindari",
      "text": "So it kind of works out great as far as project champions."

      "speaker": "Rachael Lindblom",
      "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ashlee Jack",
